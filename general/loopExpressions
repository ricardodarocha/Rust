# Loop expressions:

Rust supports four loop expressions:
- A **loop** expression denotes an infinite loop.
- A **while** expression loops until a predicate is false.
- A **while let** expression tests a pattern.
- A **for** expression extracts values from an iterator, looping until the iterator is empty.
All four types of loop support break expressions, continue expressions, and labels. Only loop supports evaluation to non-trivial values.

### Loop
``` Rust
loop { println!("I live."); }
```

### while
``` Rust
let mut i = 0;

while i < 10 {
    println!("hello");
    i = i + 1;
}
```

### while let
``` Rust
let mut x = vec![1, 2, 3];

while let Some(y) = x.pop() {
    println!("y = {}", y);
}

```

Multiple patterns may be specified with the | operator. This has the same semantics as with | in match expressions:

``` Rust
let mut vals = vec![2, 3, 1, 2, 2];
while let Some(v @ 1) | Some(v @ 2) = vals.pop() {
    // Prints 2, 2, then 1
    println!("{}", v);
}
```

### For
A for expression is a syntactic construct for looping over elements provided by an implementation of std::iter::IntoIterator. If the iterator yields a value, that value is matched against the irrefutable pattern, the body of the loop is executed, and then control returns to the head of the for loop. If the iterator is empty, the for expression completes.

```Rust
for x in 10 { println!("{}", x)}
//0..9
```

```Rust
for x in 1..11{ // 11 is not inclusive
      if x==5 {
         continue;
      }
```

An example of a for loop over the contents of an array:

``` Rust
let v = &["apples", "cake", "coffee"];

for text in v {
    println!("I like {}.", text);
}
```

An example of a for loop over a series of integers:

``` Rust
let mut sum = 0;
for n in 1..11 {
    sum += n;
}
assert_eq!(sum, 55);
```

## Looping break
``` Rust
let mut i = 0;

while i < 10 {

    if x 5 {
        break; }
        
    i = i + 1;
    println!("hello{}", I);
}
```

When associated with a loop, a break expression may be used **to return a value** from that loop, via one of the forms break EXPR or break 'label EXPR, where EXPR is an expression whose result is returned from the loop. For example:


```Rust
// Fibonacci
let (mut a, mut b) = (1, 1);
let result = loop {
    if b > 10 {
        break b;
    }
    let c = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
};
// first number in Fibonacci sequence over 10:
assert_eq!(result, 13);
```
