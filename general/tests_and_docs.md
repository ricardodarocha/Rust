in this section I will do an overview of 2 kind of relevant rust code structures
code documentaion and code tests 

to give your code documentaion superpower just write comments with 3 /// instead of 2 // 

/// will appear as discussion text at generated documentaion

lets create an example
```Rust
/// this method provides a very good aproximation of pi using the razor 22/7
fn rpi {22/7}
/// Usage 
/// ```
///fn circleArea (r) {
///    
///    r * r * rpi()
///}
/// ```
```
